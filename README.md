# CsOhm

CsOhm is Object-Hash Mapping library for .NET inspired by [Ohm](http://github.com/soveran/ohm).

CsOhm is a library for storing POCOs in [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis). The design goal is to be non-invasive, using attribute declarations and reflection to achieve functionality with minimal setup and configuration.

## Features
This project is a work in progress. These are currently available features:

- Basic attribute persistence (String, Integer, etc...)
- Auto-numeric Ids
